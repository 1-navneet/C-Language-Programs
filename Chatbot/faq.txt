variable
In C, a variable is a named location in memory that stores data which can be changed during program execution.

constant
A constant is a named memory location whose value cannot be changed after initialization.

pointer
A pointer stores the address of another variable. It allows indirect manipulation of variables and dynamic memory management.

array
An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.

function
Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task and can be called multiple times.

loop
In C, loops execute a block of code multiple times. Common loops are for, while, and do-while.

struct
A struct is a user-defined data type that groups related variables of different types.

dynamic memory
Dynamic memory allocation allows allocating memory at runtime using functions like malloc and free.

header file
Header files contain declarations for functions and macros and are included using #include.

compile error
Errors that occur during code compilation, often due to syntax or type issues.

runtime error
Errors occurring during execution, such as division by zero or invalid memory access.
