# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) in C

## Description
This program finds the length of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two input strings. LCS is a fundamental problem in dynamic programming and string analysis, used widely in bioinformatics, text comparison, and version control.

## How it Works
- Takes two strings as inputs.
- Uses dynamic programming to compute the length of their LCS.

## Example
Input: "AGGTAB", "GXTXAYB"
Output: Length of LCS: 4

## Usage
Compile and run:
gcc longest_common_subsequence.c -o lcs
./lcs
