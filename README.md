Hi — I’m Dimpesh Panwar 👋
Welcome to the C Language Programs repo for Hacktoberfest 2025! This repo is all about small, well-documented C programs that help beginners learn and contributors practice open-source collaboration.

# What I'm Looking For

- **Follow my GitHub account** ✅  
- **Fork this repository** and create a **unique Pull Request (PR)** — avoid duplicating existing solutions.  
- **Clear and Documented Code:** PRs with well-written code, meaningful comments, and a short description are more likely to be accepted.  
- **Beginner-Friendly & Educational:** Keep your contributions accessible and helpful for beginners.

1. ⭐ **Follow my GitHub account**  
2. 🍴 **Fork this repository**  
3. 🔀 **Create a new branch**  : git checkout -b feature/your-short-title

✍️ **Add your C program** inside a descriptive folder  
*Example:* `sorting/quick_sort.c`

📝 **Include a short README or comment at the top of your file** containing:  
- **Program name**  
- **Problem statement**  
- **Input / Output examples**  
- **Complexity** (if applicable)  


🔁 **Commit with a meaningful message**  
```bash
git commit -m "Add: bubble sort with explanation"
```
📤 **Push your branch and open a PR** to `main` with a clear title and description  

✅ **Ensure your PR is unique** — check existing files before adding


# Pull Request (PR) Checklist & Code Style Guidelines

Before submitting your pull request, please ensure the following:

## PR Checklist

- ✅ **Program compiles successfully** with `gcc`  
  *Mention the exact command used, e.g.:* `gcc -o program program.c`

- ✅ **File placement & naming**:  
  Place your file in an appropriate folder and give it a clear, descriptive name.  
  *Example:* `math/fibonacci_iterative.c`

- ✅ **Examples provided**:  
  Include a couple of input/output examples in comments at the top of your file or in a small README.

- ✅ **No duplicates**:  
  Make sure the solution does not already exist in the repository.

- ✅ **PR description**:  
  Add a short, clear description of your approach in the PR body.

## Code Style & Conventions

- Use **clear and descriptive variable names**.  
- Include **meaningful comments** explaining your code.  
- Keep **functions short and focused** on a single task.  
- Prefer **standard I/O** (`scanf`/`printf`) for examples.  
- If your program uses **advanced features**, briefly explain them at the top of the file.  

# Ideas to Contribute

Here are some ways you can contribute to the repository:

- **Classic algorithms** (sorting, searching)  
- **Number theory** (GCD, prime checks)  
- **Data structures** (linked list, stack, queue)  
- **Small games** (e.g., tic-tac-toe CLI)  
- **Problem-solving examples** (recursion, dynamic programming basics)  
- **Useful utilities** (file I/O examples)

# New Example Programs Added in This Branch

- `file_io_examples.c` — demonstrates basic file read/write using `fopen`, `fgets`, and `fprintf`.  
- `dynamic_array.c` — simple vector-like dynamic array with push and automatic resizing.  
- `linked_list_example.c` — singly linked list with insert, delete, and print functions.  
- `bst_example.c` — binary search tree with insert and inorder traversal.
