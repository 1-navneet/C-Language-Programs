# Topological Sort (DFS) in C

## Description
This program implements Topological Sort for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using Depth First Search (DFS). Topological sort is useful in tasks scheduling, build systems, and resolving dependencies.

## How it Works
- Constructs a sample DAG (customizable).
- Applies DFS-based topological sorting and prints the order.

## Example
A sample graph with 6 vertices and edges is topologically sorted.

## Usage
Compile and run:

gcc topological_sort.c -o topsort
./topsort
